**Step I :** Choose a mode of operation from **PART I**

**Step II :** Select KeySize, Plaintext, KeyText, Intialization vector(IV)(for ECB and OFB modes only) and CTR(forctr mode only) in **PART II**

**Step III :** Whenever necessay use XOR opeartion in **PART III** in accordance with choosen mode of operation

**Step IV :** Use fuction **FK** and "Key in hex:" field in **PART IV** should be filled keytext generated in **Step2**

**Step V :** Fill "Plaintext in hex:" field with approriate value in accordance with choosen mode of operation and click on encrypt button

**Step VI :** Enter your answer in **PART V** to check your ciphertext
